# Next JS Quiz Builder App

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create an `.env` file in the project root.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000 // or whatever port your server side code is pointed to
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN=FAKE-API-TOKEN-123456789 // can be anything, btw
```

Once done, you can now run the app locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- It doesn't accept indices as answers in MCQ questions/prompts as mentioned in the requirements. It only accepts the string equivalent.
- I wasn't able to add `code` as a question type.
- Some of the components use `any` as type ðŸ˜…
